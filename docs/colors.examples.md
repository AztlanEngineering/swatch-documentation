We write most of the examples with **x** variable but you need to know that all the examples work with **y** and **z** variables as well.
You can test them yourself.

### background color

```jsx live
<div class='x-yellow'>
	<h2 class='b-dark-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='b-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='b-light-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
</div>
```

---

### Foreground color

There is three shades of each color to use where ever you need same as background color:


```jsx live
<div class='x-red'>
	<h2 class='c-dark-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='c-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='c-light-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
</div>
```

### On color

With this property we can select the foreground color of our text over the background we choose without testing which color fits it because the Alphabet-SCSS will choose the best color for us.


```jsx live
<div class='x-green y-white z-red'>
	<h2 class='b-x c-on-x'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='b-y c-on-y'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
	<h2 class='b-z c-on-z'>Alphabet-SCSS</h2>
</div>
```
