### Why should we choose Alphabet-SCSS?

Alphabet-SCSS is created by SASS laguage and includes the CSS4 variables which makes it a lot more creative and a lot easier to use, also helps you to have a lot more possibilities in UI design. You can see in the grid system or in color and background color and etc.

### What are the advantages?

One of the advantages about Alphabet-SCSS is that it uses CSS4 variables which allows you to change it at run time which lets you create a theming system for example: 

CSS4 variables cascade and etc. We use SASS language too since CSS4 variables can't fulfill all of our needs so it will be a deadly combination using both their features in one library.

### How do we use it?

Just like a normal CSS file we should link the extracted `main.css` file from the SASS to our HTML file and use it's classes in the class names. Easy right?
